#   Genetic Disease Detection Program


# English
# Program Introduction: 
The ultimate goal of this program is to output the disease result after uploading the base sequence for comparison
Still in trial phase, so all results are subject to reality
The currently uploaded detection_by_similarity.py file is a program that achieves output results by comparing base sequence similarities
The main mechanism is: set a threshold, compare the output base sequence with the existing base sequence in the library, and judge whether it is diseased or not according to the similarity threshold
In addition, I am currently trying to make a program that uses the codons in the base sequence to transcribe into RNA and translate into protein and compare the protein sequence
The general mechanism is annotated in the py file, if you are interested, please come and check it out

# Meaning Intorduction: 
In my opinion, the detection of genetic diseases is very important. Genetic diseases are biological diseases caused by gene mutations, which have a higher risk of being passed on to future generations, so testing for them is very necessary. Detecting genetic diseases can provide families with early diagnosis and intervention, and help to better manage and cope with these diseases. In addition, genetic disease testing can help doctors evaluate family history and diagnose genetic-related diseases. Therefore, the detection of genetic diseases is very important, and it plays an irreplaceable role in ensuring family health and preventing gene-related diseases. In this regard, I want to develop a program for the comparison and detection of genetic diseases

# About the Author: 
I am a seventeen-year-old high school student from China.Because my school is a boarding school, there may only be bi-weekly activities for updating and responding to feedback. I am currently very interested in python and its derivative libraries. I hope I can make better works and solve practical problems. I hope that the seniors on Github can give me some help

# 程序介绍: 
这个程序的最终目标是可以通过上传碱基序列进行比对后输出患病结果
现在仍处于试做的阶段，一切结果以实际为准
目前上传的 detection_by_similarity.py 文件是通过比较碱基序列相似度来达成输出结果的程序
主要机理就是：设置一个阀值，将输出的碱基序列与库中已经存在的碱基序列进行比对，根据相似度阀值来判断是否患病
另外目前在试图制作一个利用碱基序列中的密码子转录成RNA并翻译成蛋白质并比较蛋白质序列的程序
大致机理在py文件中附有注释，若有兴趣欢迎莅临查看

# 意义介绍: 
依我所见，遗传病的检测是十分重要的。遗传病是由于基因突变导致的生物学疾病，其传递给后代的风险较高，因此对其进行检测是非常必要的。检测遗传病可以为家族提供早期诊断和干预，并有助于更好地管理和应对这些疾病。此外，遗传病检测还可以帮助医生评估家族史和诊断基因相关疾病。所以说，检测遗传病是十分重要的，对于保障家族健康，预防基因相关疾病有着不可替代的作用。对此，我想开发一款关于遗传病比对检测的程序

我是一个来自中国的十七岁高中生，因为学校是寄宿制，所以可能只有双周才可以进行更新和回复反馈的活动。我目前对python及其衍生库有着浓厚兴趣，并且希望自己可以做出比较优良的作品，希望可以解决实际问题，希望在github上面的前辈们可以给予我一部分帮助
