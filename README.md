#   Genetic Disease Detection Program


# English

#Program Introduction:

The ultimate goal of this program is to input a base sequence and output disease results after comparison. 

Currently, the program is still in the experimental stage. The file "detection_by_similarity.py" in the directory is a program that outputs results by comparing the similarity of base sequences. The main mechanism is to set a threshold and compare the output base sequence with the existing base sequences in the library to determine whether the patient has the disease based on the similarity threshold. Additionally, we are currently attempting to create a program that transcribes the codons in the base sequence into RNA, translates them into proteins, and compares the protein sequences. The general mechanism is described in the Python file comments. If you're interested, you're welcome to take a look and provide your ideas and suggestions for improvement.

#Significance Introduction:

Genetic diseases are biological diseases caused by gene mutations. The risk of passing them on to offspring is high, so it is necessary to test for them. Genetic disease testing can provide early diagnosis and intervention for families and help better manage and respond to these diseases. Additionally, genetic disease testing can help doctors evaluate family history and diagnose gene-related diseases. Therefore, genetic disease testing plays an irreplaceable role in safeguarding family health and preventing gene-related diseases. With that in mind, I want to develop a free and open-source genetic disease comparison and testing program for anyone to use. I welcome everyone to participate in this project.


#About The Author:

I am a 17-year-old high school student from China. My school is a boarding school, so I can only update or respond to feedback every other week when I go home. In the future, I want to study a life science-related major in college and have a strong interest in the application of Python in the field of life sciences and its derivative libraries. I also hope to make good works and try to solve practical problems. If you have experience in this area, I look forward to your help with this project.

#程序介绍:

这个程序的最终目标是：通过上传碱基序列进行比对后输出患病结果。

现在仍处于试做的阶段，目录中的 detection_by_similarity.py文件，是通过比较碱基序列相似度，来输出结果的程序。 主要机理就是：设置一个阀值，将输出的碱基序列与库中已经存在的碱基序列进行比对，根据相似度阀值来判断是否患病。另外目前在试图制作一个利用碱基序列中的密码子转录成RNA，并翻译成蛋白质，并比较蛋白质序列的程序。大致机理在py文件中附有注释，若有兴趣欢迎莅临查看，并提出您的想法和改善意见。

#意义介绍:

遗传病是由于基因突变导致的生物学疾病，其传递给后代的风险较高，因此对其进行检测是非常必要的。检测遗传病可以为家族提供早期诊断和干预，并有助于更好地管理和应对这些疾病。此外，遗传病检测还可以帮助医生评估家族史和诊断基因相关疾病。所以说，检测遗传病对于保障家族健康，预防基因相关疾病有着不可替代的作用。对此，我想开发一个免费的、开源的遗传病比对检测程序供任何人使用，也欢迎大家来共同参与这个项目。
